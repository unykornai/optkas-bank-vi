# Regulatory Matrix
# =================
# Maps each jurisdiction to its regulatory authorities per activity type.
# Used by the regulatory claim validator to check:
#   - Is the claimed regulator valid for that jurisdiction?
#   - Is the claimed activity legally possible without specific licenses?
#   - Does the entity type match the declared activity?
#
# This is the source of truth for regulatory validation.
